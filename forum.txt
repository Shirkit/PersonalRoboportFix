    [spoiler=Long description]Disables the personal roboport you are wearing when you go inside your construction network.

It stores the charged energy, so you don't lose it.

It should support both vanilla and modded Roboports, Robots and Personal Robopots.

In theory it should be multiplayer compatible, but I haven't test it.[/spoiler]
