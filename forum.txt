    [spoiler=Long description]Disables the personal roboport you are wearing when you go inside your construction network.

You [u]CAN'T[/u] have more than the limit of construction robots on all of your inventory (quickbar and main), or this mod [u]WILL FAIL[/u]. For example, if you have 2 Personal Roboports, you can't have more than 20 robots on your inventory.

It stores the charged energy, so you don't lose it.

For now, it just supports vanilla Roboports and Personal Roboports. Planned to support modded roboports and personal roboports soon.

In theory it should be multiplayer compatible, but I haven't test it.[/spoiler]
